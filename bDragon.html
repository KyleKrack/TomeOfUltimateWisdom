        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Black Dragon is a fearsome foe known for its cunning intelligence and affinity for the dark waters of swamps and marshes. Its scales glisten like obsidian, making it nearly invisible in its natural habitat.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>Black Dragons are characterized by their long, sinuous bodies and massive wings. Their eyes glow with a malevolent red hue, and their breath weapon is a noxious cloud of acid that can corrode armor and flesh alike.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>These dragons prefer dark, wet environments such as swamps, bogs, and underground caverns. They are territorial and often create lairs filled with treasures stolen from unsuspecting travelers.</p>

        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Acid Breath:</strong> A powerful cone of acid that deals damage and may corrode armor.</li>
            <li><strong>Invisibility:</strong> Can become invisible in dim light or darkness.</li>
            <li><strong>Intimidating Presence:</strong> Causes fear in weaker creatures within a certain radius.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
        <p>Despite their formidable power, Black Dragons have a weakness to lightning damage. Additionally, they are vulnerable to radiant magic and spells that dispel illusions.</p>

        <h2>Tactics</h2>
        <p>Black Dragons are cunning adversaries that prefer to ambush their prey. They often use their environment to their advantage, striking from the shadows before retreating to safety.</p>

        <h2>Encountering a Black Dragon</h2>
        <p>Adventurers should be well-prepared when facing a Black Dragon. Knowledge of its abilities and weaknesses can mean the difference between victory and defeat. Seek out allies, and consider using spells or items that can counteract its acid breath.</p>

        <h2>Loot</h2>
        <p>Defeating a Black Dragon may yield valuable rewards, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dragon Scale Armor (provides high protection)</li>
            <li>Gold and gems from its hoard</li>
            <li>Magic items infused with dragon essence</li>
        </ul>
